                        <li>Engineered  a full-stack AWS live-site operations tool, significantly boosting engineer productivity by automating manual processes for correlating fleetwide deployments in order to isolate root cause.</li>
                        <li>Developed an AWS Lambda microservice in Java, integrating with six internal AWS APIs to automate the correlation of regional deployments with incident tickets, reducing a tedious, multi-step manual process from 10 steps to 1.</li>
                        <li>Created a React component in TypeScript, deployed on a live-site tools dashboard, improving accessibility and speed for on call engineers.</li>
                        <li>Streamlined incident management via automated ticket comments, reducing engineer workload by posting correlated regional deployments as ticket comments to further accelerate root cause identification.</li>
                        <li>Collaborated with cross-functional teams and engineers to define technical requirements, onboard to necessary services, implement secure authentication, and ensure seamless deployment in compliance with AWS standards.</li>

                    <h2>AWS Live-Site Operations Tool</h2>
                    <p>
                        For my intern project at AWS, I built a live-site operations tool to aid on call developers in 
                        root cause analysis. It allowed for the user to put a ticket ID into the tool, and it would automatically retrieve 
                        recent related deployments. It also allowed for the data found by the tool to be added to the 
                        comments of the ticket for ease of access. (Can't show picture of tool due to confidentiality.)

                        PantryPal is an AI recipe generation app written in Java that used ChatGPT's API, Whisper API, and MongoDB. It allows the 
                        user to input the type of meal they want and their available ingredients, and have a list of recipes generated only requiring 
                        the given ingredients.
