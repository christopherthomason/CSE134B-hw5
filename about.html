                <h2>Programming History</h2>
                <p>
                    My first experience with any form of programming was in first grade when I started making games on Scratch, 
                    starting with a game where a shark would ask me multiplication questions to help me learn my times tables. 
                    Eventually, when I was 10, I started learning Python and a few other programming languages using Codecademy. 
                    <br><br>
                    Despite this early start, I didn't fully delve into programming until high school, where I started to really 
                    hone my skills and develop more than just tiny programs. I kept this up and a few years later was accepted into 
                    UC San Diego's Computer Science program.
                    <br><br>
                    While in this program, I took a wide variety of Computer Science courses and rounded myself out more as a developer. 
                    This experience eventually led to an internship at AWS in the summer after my Junior year where I got to 
                    experience what it would be like to be a developer in industry.

                <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                <p>
                    While I am not programming or working on other course work, some of my favorite things to do are to
                    hang out with friends, play Ultimate Frisbee, or play video games. 
                    <br><br>
                    I started playing frisbee during my Sophomore year of high school with a group of my friends and 
                    immediately fell in love with the sport. I played non-stop, even joining a travel team during the summer, 
                    until COVID hit and I was forced to stop. I also played for UC San Diego's Ultimate Frisbee team for a period of 
                    time, but eventually fell away from the sport.
                    <br><br>
                    Video games have been a staple in my life since I was young, and I have found that they have been an important 
                    way for me to keep in touch with friends that I have moved away from and to overall stay social 
                    during the isolation of COVID.

                <h2>Other Information</h2>
                <p>
                    During my life, I have been fortunate enough to travel to many places and experience living in different 
                    areas. 
                    <br><br>
                    Despite the difficulty that arises from frequent moves, I eventually learned to appreciate the 
                    adaptability that came from the changes and all of the different people I got to meet in each place I lived. 
                    <br><br>
                    I have also learned to love traveling and getting to see a large variety of different places and cultures. 
                    I have been able to visit over 40 countries so far and would love to keep adding to that list as I get older.
